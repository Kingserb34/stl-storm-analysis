This project explores storm events reported in St. Louis County, Missouri over the past decade using data from the National Weather Service. Using Tableau, I visualized trends, impact, and narratives behind storms such as hail, thunderstorm winds, and excessive heat.

## 📊 Tools Used

- **Python / Pandas** – for data cleaning

## 📈 Key Insights
- Storm activity peaks in late spring and early summer
- Thunderstorm winds and hail are the most common storm types
